Game anywhere. This is a conceptual "games-as-a-service" collaboration between Apple and Nintendo. 
<br>
<br>
By combining Nintendo's popular software with Apple's powerful hardware, Apple and Nintendo could offer games for streaming and downloading on all Apple products. Apple's hardware would allow Nintendo developers to enact their creative visions without compromise, while exposing new audiences to Nintendo games.

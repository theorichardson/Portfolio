<div class="description">
<p>
I am the designer at Xesto, a University of Toronto accelerated computer vision startup. I designed the Xesto app and brand identity for the company, both of which launched in November 2020. The app harnesses the power of the FaceID camera in iPhones X and above to help users scan and size their feet for online shoe shopping.<br><br>Here is some of my design process.</p>

      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/instruction1.png"></div>

 </div>

<p><strong>Brief:</strong><br><br>
The Xesto app relies on the FaceID camera in iPhones X and up for TrueDepth scanning. Therefore, a constraint baked into the app is that the scanning process takes place with the phone screen facing away from the user.<br><br>The first step in addressing this pain point was a redesign of the instructions presented to the user. The instructions helped myself and the engineers map out the experience journey for users, examining each step in the process that would need explaining.</p>

      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/scanUI1.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/scanUI2.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/scanUI3.png"></div>
 </div>

<p><p><strong>UI Testing & Feedback:</strong><br><br>
We then tested 3 different scanning user interfaces with users who had never been exposed to the products before. We got strong feedback that the "target" method of lining the camera up with an image of a foot was far too difficult, though multiple users had suggested it at an earlier stage. We realized that while our first UI was too open ended, the target method was too restrictive. We asked "How can the app hold the users hand throughout the scanning process?" and paid attention to how we would explain the scanning process when we intervened in unsuccessful user testing. This led us to the idea of a guided UI wherein Xesto checks in with the user throughout the scanning process.

      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/guided2.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/guided3.png"></div>
 </div>

<p><strong>Successful UI:</strong><br><br>
With the guided UI, approximately 80% of users took successful scans for the first time. The key to this UI was pauses between each photograph that require the user's manual approval. "Does your photo look like this?" and a visual cue reduced error by a large margin.<br><br>I then went about designing the interface to display and interact with the scans and resulting sizing information.</p>

      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/UI1.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/UI2.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/UI3.png"></div>
 </div>

<p><strong>"My Scans" Interface:</strong><br><br>
We wanted the page displaying scans to be simple and playful. We experimented with different layouts but landed on one with buttons for each funtion that the user can toggle in and out of, leaving the majority of the screen free to display the foot scans.

      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/finalUI3.png"></div>
      <div id="inner-div"><img src="images/xesto/finalUI4.png"></div>
 </div>

 <p><strong>Successful "My Scans" Interface:</strong><br><br>
 	The buttons toggle the left and right foot scans, in and out of photogaphic mode and into a technical sizing information screen.

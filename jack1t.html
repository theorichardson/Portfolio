<div class="chairDescription"> 
<p>This is the conceptual design work I did during my internship at luxury retail design company Ink Associates. I was charged with designing conceptual tradeshow booths for luxury jacket company JACK1T, from the founder of Bench and SuperDry. <br><br>The tradeshow booths I designed were inspired by the angular, exaggerated identity of the brand and the luxurious materials used in their jackets. I also worked off of the work that Ink Associates had done for JACK1T at Pitti Uomo the winter before.<br><br>

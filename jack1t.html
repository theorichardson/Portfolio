<div class="chairDescription"> 
<p>This is the conceptual design work I did during my internship at luxury retail interior design company Ink Associates. I was charged with designing conceptual tradeshow booths for luxury jacket company JACK1T, from the founder of Bench and SuperDry. <br><br>This project was an exercise in designing for a new brand while offering contributions to the brand identity. The tradeshow booths I designed were inspired by JACK1T's angular, exaggerated logo and the luxurious materials used in their jackets. I also built on the work that Ink Associates had done for JACK1T at Pitti Uomo the winter before my time with the company.<br><br>
